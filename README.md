# Yard
Yard is an funny programming language compiler and interpreter written in pure Rust
It *will* contain features such as:
1. a COMEFROM keyword (inverse goto)
2. a ```don't``` code block which never executes
3. ```rand(x)``` returns x, always. 
4. no if. only `unless`, an inverted version of if. Meaning a block get executed if the is false and doesn't if it is true
